Variations and Optimizations of the DeepLabV3+ Model

The DeepLabv3+ is a semantic segmentation architecture that improves upon DeepLabv3 with several improvements, such as adding a simple yet effective decoder module to achieve an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder module processes multiscale contextual information by applying dilated convolution at multiple scales, while the decoder module refines the segmentation results along object boundaries.

The present repository provides some variations and enhancements of the DeepLabV3+ using the Tensorflow library (Version 2.4.1). Some of the enhancements present in the proposed models include but are not limited to:

* Adjusted ASPP Dilation Rates:

Changed dilation rates to 12, 24, 36 for larger receptive fields.

* Added Dropout:

Included dropout layers in convolution blocks for regularization.

* Improved Upsampling:

Replaced bilinear interpolation with transposed convolution for learned upsampling.

* Enhanced Skip Connections:

Used low-level features from ResNet101's stage 2 for better detail reconstruction.

* Deeper Backbone (ResNet101 / Xception):

Deeper networks generally capture richer semantic features, leading to better performance on complex segmentation tasks.

* ASPP Refinement:

Adding multiple parallel dilated convolutions at different rates enables the model to capture multi-scale contextual information, which is crucial for segmenting objects of varying sizes.

* Attention Mechanisms (Squeeze-and-Excitation):

Helps the network focus on the most discriminative channels/features, often leading to better segmentation accuracy.

* Dropout:

Reduces overfitting, improving generalization to unseen data.

* Decoder Refinements:

Combining low-level features (which have high spatial resolution but low semantic content) with high-level features (which have high semantic content but lower resolution) helps in better boundary delineation and segmentation accuracy.
